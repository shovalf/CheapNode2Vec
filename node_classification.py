"""
Node classification Task For Evaluation:
Full explanation for what is done can be found the survey file in our github page.
Code explanation:
For this task, one should have a labeled graph: 2 files are required: Graph edges in '.edgelist' or '.txt' format and
nodes' labels in '.txt' format. For labeled graphs examples you can enter the link in the github page. You should
insert them in the appropriate place in the main function in the file 'directed_cheap_node2vec' or
'undirected_cheap_node2vec', depends on your graph's type.
This task compares two things:
1. Compare performance of our method and regular node2vec, i.e. we do the same task with both methods, calculate
    needed scores and compare between them - This would be mission 1.
2. Only for our method, compare the success of the task (measuring by several scores) for different number of nodes
    in the initial projection - This would be mission 2.
For mission 1: Go to the file 'directed_cheap_node2vec' (or undirected). In the main function change 'initial' variable
    to a list that consists the percentage of nodes you want in the initial projection (for example, for pubmed2, 0.975
    means 100 nodes in the initial projection). Go back to this file and run main(1, 'directed'/'undirected').
For mission 2: Go to the file 'directed_cheap_node2vec' (or undirected). In the main function, change 'initial' variable
    to a list that consists a number of percentages of nodes you want in the initial projection (for example, for
    pubmed2 the list is [0.975, 0.905, 0.715, 0.447, 0.339], meaning run with 100 nodes in the initial projection, then
    with 1000, 3000, 7000 and 10000). Go back to this file to the function 'initial_proj_vs_scores' and replace x
    to be equal to 'initial' list you changed earlier. Then, you can run this file- main(2, 'directed'/'undirected'.
